# ZaidinCoffeScraper
Tinny CafÃ©s Zaidin / Soy Cafetera Coffee Scraper

This is not a serious project, just a scraper that helps me search for the cheapest to most expensive coffees our my favourite coffee roaster (with the process type).

This Python script uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) to scrape coffee products from [soycafetera.es](https://www.soycafetera.es/tienda/). It extracts the product name, price, and coffee processing method, then sorts them by price per kilogram.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Headless scraping via Playwright (Chromium)
- Auto-detection of product packaging (250g, 500g, etc.)
- Smart price normalization to â‚¬/kg
- Process and origin parsing from product pages
- Handles multiple layout versions (grid and legacy)
- Outputs grouped coffee info by origin
- Automatically handles cookies and lazy-loaded pages

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Playwright for Python](https://playwright.dev/python/)
- [dependency-injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install playwright dependency-injector
playwright install
```

## Status

This project is just for testing and educational purposes. It works for me, so I probably wonâ€™t fix the missing fields in the coffee descriptions.
